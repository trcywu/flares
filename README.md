## Flares

### Introduction
This is a Ruby on Rails project built between 21/04/2016 - 26/01/2016. This is 2/4 projects that were completed during the General Assembly Web Immersive Course. 

### The Idea

Every day, hundreds of tickets and reservations that could not be honoured at the last minute due to conflicting circumstances are gone to waste. This is a website where users can browse through last minute listings of tickets/events that people cannot attend and are happy to give away to whoever is available.

### Planning

Below is a snapshot of how I planned the execution of the project.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were drawn by hand and then brought to life via Balsamiq to visualise the user journey for the website.
