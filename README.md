## Flares

This is a website on geolocation ticket discovery. When someone has a last minute ticket before an event that they don't want to go to waste, they can go on the wesbite and give it away. There is no exchange of money and is on a first come first serve basis. 

A flare is ignited with the details of the ticket, and extinguished once someone has taken up on the offer or passed the start time of the event. 

User story

Amy and Zoe had tickets to see Adele on Thursday night at 7pm. At 6pm on the day, she receives a call from Zoe to say that she has food poisonin having ate some bad sushi at lunch and cannot leave the bathroom. Not wanting the $150 ticket to go to waste, Amy frantically calls around her circle of friends to see if anyone else is available but at such short notice couldn't find anyone.

Enter Flares.

At 6:30pm, with only 30 minutes to go before the start of the concert, Amy posts up her spare ticket on Flares.
